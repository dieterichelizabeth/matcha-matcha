            Hey there! Are you new to plant parenting? It's okay if you're
            feeling a little unsure about how to take care of your new plant,
            but don't worry, we've got you covered!
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Owning plants can be a relaxing and fun hobby, and anyone can
            develop a green thumb with the right information. So, let's dive
            into some key tips for new indoor plant owners:

            marginTop="10"

            fontSize="lg"
          >
            Tip #1: Get to know your plant. Every plant is unique and has
            different needs. But don't worry, you'll learn how to recognize
            these needs with time and experience. Some plants are
            low-maintenance and don't require much attention, while others need
            a bit more TLC. You can check out the care card that comes with your
            plant to learn more about your specific plant's preferences.

            fontSize="lg"
          >
            Tip #2: Don't water your plant too often. Overwatering is one of the
            most common mistakes new plant parents make. Most potted houseplants
            prefer their soil volume to dry out 50% to 75% of the way between
            waterings. So, be sure to check the soil moisture before watering
            and make sure your pot has a drainage hole to prevent your plant
            from sitting in soggy soil.

            fontSize="lg"
          >
            Tip #3: Choose the right spot. When it comes to indoor plants, it's
            all about the light! Different plants have different light exposure
            preferences, so it's important to choose the right spot for your
            plant.

            fontSize="lg"
          >
            Tip #4: Be patient! It's completely normal for your plant to take a
            few weeks to adjust to its new environment. If you notice a few
            leaves dropping off, don't worry! Just keep providing consistent
            soil moisture, lighting, and temperature, and you'll soon see new
            growth.
